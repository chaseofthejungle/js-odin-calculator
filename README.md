# JS Odin Calculator

**Description:** This app is a simple calculator program, created as a [JavaScript exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) for [The Odin Project web foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). It is functionally and (somewhat) visually similar to the [macOS Calculator program](https://support.apple.com/guide/calculator/welcome/mac).
